# Forecast Algorithm

## Description

The purpose of this algorithm is to create daily balances for a given account. The algorithm will take in a starting balance, a list of transactions, a list of incomes, and a length of time to predict. The algorithm will then return a list of daily balances for the given length of time.

Step 1: Create a list of dates for the given length of time.

Step 2: For each date take either the starting balance or the previous balance and add the income if any and subtract the transactions if any.

Step 3: Return the list of daily balances.


## Forecast Algorithm

List of incomes with dates and repeated frequency

list of expenses with dates and repeated frequency

starting balance 

starting date

Forecast length 

starting  balance



Create a list of all incomes derived from frequency and forecast length

    refresh date to current month
    


create a lost of all expenses derived from frequency and forecast length

create a list with the starting balance

for each day in forecast length

find any matching dates in income

Total matching income

add income to balance

find any matching dates in expenses

total matching expenses

substract expenses from balance

display date, balance, list of matching incomes, and list of matching expenses
